# text-2-speech-reader
This is my first small Python project 

It converts text 2 speech and read it. You can choose between German and English.
You can choose if it shut saved or not. 
It's GUI based and made with the Google gtts Module

I hope you enjoy. 
If you have some ideas to optimize, leave a comment.
(I will add a way to choose the Saving path in the GUI)
